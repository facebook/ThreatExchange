* C++ 11 or higher
* `CImg.h` is included for reference, although note that its license does not allow commercial use. It is expected that your company will already have image-processing logic. Dependencies of this code on `CImg.h` are confined solely to `io/pdqio.h` and `io/pdqio.cpp` which you can customize for your site.
