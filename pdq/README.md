# PDQ reference implementation

## Description

This is the reference implementation for the PDQ hashing algorithm.

Please see [../hashing.pdf](https://github.com/facebook/ThreatExchange/blob/main/hashing/hashing.pdf)
within this repository for an explanation of the algorithm.

See also https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2019/08/open-source-photo-video-matching for context.

As of November 2018 there are C++, PHP, and Java implementations.  Details are in the `*/README.md` files.

## Other Bindings and Implementations
* Python: [faustomorales/pdqhash-python](https://github.com/faustomorales/pdqhash-python)
* Rust: [darwinium-com/pdqhash](https://github.com/darwinium-com/pdqhash) - a great visualization of the algorithm also lives here.
