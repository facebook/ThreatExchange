Threat intelligence comes to us in numerous types: a domain name used by a
botnet, a URL delivering malware, a file name written to disk by some malware.
These are disparate data and need different kinds of metadata to make them
useful to others.

To ensure consistency, the ThreatExchange APIs and its consumers use JSON
objects as their default currency. Using these APIs gives you a lot of things
for free:

* Field validation
* Type checking
* Persistence to Facebook's Open Graph
* Everyone else can use what you share and be better protected!

All objects are formatted maps using a predefined set of field names, with
expected value types.  They can be of arbitrary size and field order in the
map is, generally, not important. 

ThreatExchange is a subset of API endpoints within the larger ecosystem of
Facebook Graph APIs. Essential documentation for interacting with Facebook
platform Graph APIs are available at
https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api.
This documentation covers key concepts: usage of access tokens for
authentication,
result pagination, and batching.  It is recommended to be familiar with the
basics of interacting with Facebook Graph APIs prior to trying out
ThreatExchange. 

### Changes in Platform version 2.4

There were a large number of changes made in Platform version 2.4. You may
continue to use Platform version 2.3, without those changes, until 8 Dec 2015.
On that day support for version 2.3 will be disabled.

The most important change in version 2.4 was was the introduction of the 
descriptor model. On version 2.3 and below, all data was stored on the 
indicator. Beginning with version 2.4, we split information into
objective and subjective categories. Objective information is data which 
everybody can see and agree upon. It may change over time, but everybody sees 
the same data. For example, the WHOIS registration for a domain name is
objective. Subjective information represents somebody's opinion on the data. 
Different people may have different opinions. For example, the status of a 
domain as being MALICIOUS or NON_MALICIOUS.

Objective information will remain stored on indicators. For the most part,
Facebook will be the only party updating objective information. Subjective 
information is now stored on a new structure called a descriptor. We have added
API calls to create, edit, and search for descriptors. Each AppID may have
one descriptor per indicator. Each descriptor has an edge connecting it
to a threat indicator. Each indicator has edges to one or more descriptors.

We currently do not support connections between descriptors. Connections
between indicators will remain the only way to associate threat information
for the time being.

### /malware\_analyses

This API call enables searching for malware stored in ThreatExchange.  With this
call you can search for malware by free text (including file hashes) or all
malware uploaded in a specific time window.  Combinations of these query types
are also allowed.

The following query parameters are available (bold params are required):

* **access\_token** - The key for authenticating to the API.  It is a
concatenation of &lt;your-app-id&gt;|&lt;your-app-secret&gt;.  For example,
if our app ID was 555 and our app secret aSdF123GhK, our access\_token would
be "555|aSdF123GhK".
* limit - Defines the maximum size of a page of results. The maximum is 1,000.
* text - Freeform text field with a value to search for.  This can be a file
hash or a string found in other fields of the objects.

## Submitting New Data

You may submit data to the graph via an HTTP POST request to either of the 
following URLs:

    https://graph.facebook.com/threat_indicators
	  https://graph.facebook.com/threat_descriptors

Both endpoints are supported in Platform version 2.4, but you should migrate
your code to the second version. Both calls are actually creating threat
descriptor objects. The first call will return the ID of the indicator
associated with your descriptor. The second call will return the ID of the
descriptor. The call to /threat\_indicators will be deprecated in a future 
version of the Platform API.

The following submission parameters are available (bold parameters are required):

* **access\_token** - The key for authenticating to the API.  It is a
concatenation of &lt;your-app-id&gt;|&lt;your-app-secret&gt;.  For example,
if our app ID was 555 and our app secret aSdF123GhK, our access\_token would
be "555|aSdF123GhK";
* confidence - A confidence rating on the indicator, from 0 to 100;
* **description** - A short summary of the indicator and threat;
* expired\_on - Time the indicator is no longer considered a threat, in
ISO 8601 date format;
* **indicator** - The indicator data being submitted.
* passwords - The MD5s of passwords associated with this indicator. Intended
for compromised credentials.
* **privacy\_type** - The kind of privacy for the indicator, see values
  defined below.
* privacy\_members - Some types of privacy require you to specify who can
  or cannot see the indicator.
* severity - A rating of how severe the indicator is when found in an incident,
see values defined below;
* share_level - A designation of how the indicator may be shared based on the
US-CERT\'s Traffic Light Protocol, https://www.us-cert.gov/tlp/
* **status** - Indicates if the indicator is labeled as malicious;
* threat\_type - The broad threat type the indicator is associated with,
see values defined below;
* **type** - The kind of indicator, see values defined below in the "Optional,
Threat Specific Fields" section.


Example submission of a malicious domain:

    https://graph.facebook.com/threat_indicators?access_token=555|aSdF123GhK

    POST DATA:
      indicator=evil-domain.biz
      &type=DOMAIN
      &threat_type=MALICIOUS_DOMAIN
      &status=MALICIOUS
      &description=This%20domain%20was%20hosting%20malware
      &privacy_type=VISIBLE


Data returned:

    {
      "id": "853037291373757",
      "success": true
    }


## Setting Privacy In ThreatExchange

All submissions to the ThreatExchange API require setting a privacy type.
This choice can limit the visibility of any indicator, if desired.
ThreatExchange supports two levels of visibility:

* allow all members;
* allow specific members;

The desired privacy setting on an indicator is specified by the values in two
fields at the time of a create or edit submission to the API:

**Name: PRIVACY\_TYPE**  
**Type: enumerated string**  
**Value: One of**  

* VISIBLE - All members of ThreatExchange can see the indicator
* HAS\_WHITELIST - Only those AppIDs specified in PRIVACY\_MEMBERS can see the
indicator.

**Name: PRIVACY\_MEMBERS**  
**Type: list of App IDs**  
**Value:**  

* A comma-delimited list of AppIDs allowed to view an
indicator in accordance with the PRIVACY\_TYPE.  NOTE:  When limiting
visibility, it is not necessary to include your own AppID. It will be added
automatically if necessary.


Example submission of a malicious domain with the privacy set to just two members

    https://graph.facebook.com/threat_indicators?access_token=555|aSdF123GhK

    POST DATA:
      indicator=evil-domain.biz
      &type=DOMAIN
      &threat_type=MALICIOUS_DOMAIN
      &status=MALICIOUS
      &description=This%20domain%20was%20hosting%20malware
      &privacy_type=HAS_WHITELIST
      &privacy_members=123456789,9012345678


## Editing Existing Data

Existing data can be edited via an HTTP POST request to the following URL

    https://graph.facebook.com/<object_id>

You can use this format to update an indicator or a descriptor. The code
will automatically update the descriptor for you.

The following submission parameters are available (bold parameters are required):

* **access\_token** - The key for authenticating to the API.  It is a
concatenation of &lt;your-app-id&gt;|&lt;your-app-secret&gt;.  For example,
if our app ID was 555 and our app secret aSdF123GhK, our access\_token would
be "555|aSdF123GhK".
* description - A short summary of the indicator and threat;
* expired\_on - Time the indicator is no longer considered a threat, in
ISO 8601 date format;
* indicator - The indicator data being submitted.
* privacy\_type - The kind of privacy for the indicator, see the values
  defined below;
* privacy\_members - Some types of privacy require you to specify who can
  or cannot see the indicator;
* severity - A rating of how severe the indicator is when found in an incident,
see values defined below;
* share\_level - A designation of how the indicator may be shared based on
the US-CERT\'s Traffic Light Protocol, https://www.us-cert.gov/tlp/
* status - Indicates if the indicator is labeled as malicious;
* threat\_type - The broad threat type the indicator is associated with, see
values defined below;
* type - The kind of indicator, see values defined below in the "Optional,
Threat Specific Fields" section.


Example of flagging data as a false positive:

    https://graph.facebook.com/853037291373757?access_token=555|aSdF123GhK

    POST DATA:
      status=NON_MALICIOUS
      &description=Not%20malicious


Data returned:

    {
      "success": true
    }

## Submitting Connections Between Data

We support creating connections (aka edges) between pieces of data to express
relationships.  Examples of when this can be useful are for describing
URL re-direct chains or domain to IP address relationships.  However,
we support connecting any type of data to any other type.  Connections can
be created via an HTTP POST request to the following URL

    https://graph.facebook.com/<object_id>/related

In the example below we will create a connection between between the
facebook.com domain object (788497497903212) and the 173.252.120.6 IP address
object (1061383593887032), which facebook.com can resolve to via DNS.

    https://graph.facebook.com/788497497903212/related

    POST DATA:
      related_id=1061383593887032

Data returned:

    {
      "success": true
    }


NOTE: Currently, this is not supported for malware objects or threat 
descriptors, but will be in the near future.


## Deleting Data

We currently support true deletes via the API
**only for connections between data**.  A connection can be deleted via an
HTTP DELETE request to the following URL

    https://graph.facebook.com/<object_id>/related?related_id=<object_id_2>


For the data itself, we do not support true deletes.  If you wish to indicate
data is no longer valid, set the **expired\_on** field for automatic
soft-deletes and the **status** field to **NON\_MALICIOUS** for handling false
positive cases.


## Schema Core Fields
