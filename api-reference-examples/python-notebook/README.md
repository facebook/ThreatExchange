# Using  Jupyter Notebook with Facebook ThreatExchange

This part of the Facebook ThreatExchange repository contains reference notebooks for getting started doing data analysis and sharing on ThreatExchange within the iPython Notebook framework.

## Installing  Jupyter Notebook

If don't already have it installed, [this tutorial from Jupyter](https://jupyter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html) is a great introduction.

## Additional Python Packages

All of the refernce notebooks make heavy use of the following Python libraries to greatly simplify common analytical tasks.  It's recommended you install them prior to using the notebooks.  


  - [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) for data manipulation and analysis
  - [Pytx](https://pytx.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation.html) for ThreatExchange access
  - [Seaborn](https://stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/) for making charts pretty

All of the python packages mentioned can be installed via

```
pip install <package_name>
```

But, no worries, we have put the same instructions at the top of each notebook, in case you don't want to read this far :)

## Using the Notebooks

Once you have the tools installed, simply run this command from your local GitHub repository folder or copy the *.ipynb files into your existing Jupyter Notebook setup.
