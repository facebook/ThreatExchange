"Hasher-Matcher-Actioner" or HMA is a prototype reference architecture for rapidly spinning up a complete solution for matching copies of photo, video, and other content on your platform. Matching a set of technologies called "hashing" to generate anonymous signatures or "hashes" of content, which allow you to continue matching copies of that content even if you no longer have access to the content. Additionally, lists of these hashes can be shared with trusted partners, and you can share or recieve these lists via a number of APIs, such as the [National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) Hash Sharing API](https://report.cybertip.org/hashsharing/v2/documentation/), the [StopNCII.org](https://stopncii.org/) API, Meta's [ThreatExchange API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/threat-exchange/), and others.

See also [Meta's newsroom post about HMA](https://about.fb.com/news/2022/12/meta-launches-new-content-moderation-tool/).

The name "hasher, matcher, actioner" refers to the process by which new content is evaluated against banks of known content. First content is hashed into intermediate representations ("Hashes" or "Signals"), then it is matched against an index of known content, and then some action is taken as a result, such as counting the hits, or enqueuing for human review.

This README is focused on deployment, you can see a more complete overview of the features at [the project wiki](https://github.com/facebook/ThreatExchange/wiki). 

# General Architecture
HMA runs on Amazon Web Services (AWS), the code itself is packeged with Docker, and Terraform is used to spin up and tear down instances. HMA is intended to be part of a content moderation solution running in your own stack, and so we expect many users will break up individual components, write their own Terraform scripts, or run natively as needed. Additionally, we've attempted to make it possible to insert hooks in every stage of the process, which is where the bridge between your own infrastracture and HMA might occur.

# Running HMA 
Running HMA on a cloud provider will cost you money! Make sure you are ready for that before running any commands that create cloud resources.

## Dependencies
You'll need an AWS account set up. Additionally, you'll need the following tools ready:
1. [aws cli](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
2. [jq cli](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/)
3. [terraform cli](https://www.terraform.io/)
4. [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
5. [python3](https://www.python.org/) (including `pip` and `venv`)

## Spinning Up an Instance
In a horrifying misuse of Make, there is a makefile to help you get started and create some configs with default naming. More details on customization be found in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)

```bash
$ cd hasher-matcher-actioner
# Recommended: setup a virtual environment as make/terraform steps include pip install as part of initial deployment.
$ python3 -m venv ~/.venv/hma
$ source ~/.venv/hma/bin/activate 
# Before doing this step, make sure to configure the aws cli with `aws configure`
$ make dev_create_configs  # Will populate a terraform.tfvars backend.tf with default names
# Optional: edit terraform.tfvars backend.tf to your preference for names of services
$ make docker  # Will build the image from the local copy of the repo
$ make dev_create_instance  # This will upload docker to AWS and then start the instance
# At this point, you can interact with the service
$ make dev_destroy_instance  # This will wipe your instance completely, leaving no resources on the cloud
```

## Handling User Authentification in the Instance
HMA uses https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/ for user accounts. You may find that you instead want to authenticate with your own internal authorization in the long term, but in the short term, you can quickly create new user accounts to use from the [user page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cognito/users/).

## Visiting the UI
To visit your deployed UI, you'll need to get the static URL for the s3 bucket. To do that:
1. Visit the s3 management console at https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/
2. Search for "<your prefix>-webapp"
3. Click on the object, and then find the "properties" tab
4. Scroll to the bottom and find "Static Web Hosting" and grab the URL
5. Visit the URL from your browser. You should be prompted for the account you created from the Authentification step

6. After entering your information, you should see the landing page of the UI
