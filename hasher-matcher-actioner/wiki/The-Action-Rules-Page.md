ActionRules tab is used to configure [ActionRules](Glossary#actioner). ActionRules determine what [Actions](Glossary#actioner), if any, should be performed as a result of a [Match](Glossary#matcher).
# Create an ActionRule
Select **_+_** button to create a new ActionRule, fill out all required fields, select an Action which the ActionRule should trigger on a Match, and click **_√_** to save or click **_X_** to cancel.
* Name has to be unique
* Add Classifications options to the Classifications column to configure when the Action should be triggered such as only for Matches to a specific [Dataset](Glossary#matcher). Checkout the [ActionRule Reference documentation](Action-Rule-Evaluation) for more descriptions of these fields and additionally customization options.  
* Please note once you select the action for an action rule, in order to make any changes or delete the action, you will have to remove the relationship between the action and the action rule first.
