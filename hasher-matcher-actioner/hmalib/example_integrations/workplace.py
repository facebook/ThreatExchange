"""
When deployed correctly, this integration will 
 * process requests sent by a Workplace bot
 * athenticate that they came from the correct workplace bot
 * convert them to the form HMA expects
 * submit to HMA


How to ship this workplace integration using AWS:

1. In your workplace community create a bot/app
2. Give the bot permission to read from the necessary groups
3. Set WORKPLACE_APP_SECRET to be the secret from this bot
4. Set HMA_API_GATEWAY_URL to be the URL for the HMA API 
   (output when terraform apply is run)
5. Set HMA_API_TOKEN to be the authorization token used to 
   authenticate access to HMA API
6. Ship this as a lambda function in Aws. The easiest way to
   do that might be by adding it to terraform. The code in 
   examples/workplace.tf might be useful
7. Create a new API Gateway in AWS that points to this lambda
   function. You do not need to add an authenticator to the 
   path since this lambda will handle athenticating that the
   request truly came from your Workplace bot
8. Set up your workplace bot to send request to the new API 
   Gateway
9. Set up Actions and Action Rules in HMA as necessary

   An Action and Action rule to comment on the post with the 
   violating content for a match against dataset 12345 might 
   look like:

   ACTION:
      Name: WorkplaceCommentAction
      URL : https://graph.facebook.com/<content-id>/comments?message=Attention+Civilian!+This+post+violates+our+terms+of+service.+The+authorities+have+been+notified+and+they+are+on+the+way.+Good+Luck!
      Webhook Type : POST
      Headers : {"Authorization": "Bearer WORKPLACE-ACCESS-TOKEN", "User-Agent": "HMA"}

   ACTION RULE:
      Name: Comment On Workplace Matches
      Classification Conditions: 
         Dataset Source = te
         SubmittedContent has been classified = integration_source:workplace
      Action: WorkplaceCommentAction

   NOTE: 
   1. HMA will parse "<content-id>" and replace with the submitted
      content-id. This script stores uses WorkplacePostID as the 
      content-id.
   2. Replace WORKPLACE-ACCESS-TOKEN with the access token from your workplace bot
