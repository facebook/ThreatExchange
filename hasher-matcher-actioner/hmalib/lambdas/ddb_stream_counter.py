        DDB Streams do not necessarily pass the name of the table from which the
        event is sourced. This means we have to use some tricks.

        We create separate lambda functions in AWS for each table that needs a
        stream. Both the lambda functions use the same code, but an environment
        variable (SOURCE_TABLE_TYPE) is used to notify the lambda code which
        table generated the event.

        This is an enum. The values of this can be found in terraform/main.tf
        module "counters", attribute for_each.

        A subclass impl of this method should return one of those enum values.

        a) add it to terraform/main.tf:module "counters":attribute for_each

    b) determine if the update matches increment or decrement condition for any
    tracked counts.

    have write permission on any of the source tables.
