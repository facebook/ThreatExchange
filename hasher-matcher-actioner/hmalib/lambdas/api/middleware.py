"""
Inspired by Java's JAX-RS standards and perhaps most sane web frameworks. Allows
you to specify the â€¢type* of a view.

Sample usage:
>>> @dataclass
... class CupcakesResponse(JSONifiable):
...    num_cupcakes: int
...    flavor: string = int

...    def to_json(self) -> t.Dict:
...        return {
...            "num_cupcakes": self.num_cupcakes,
...            "flavor": self.flavor,
...        }

>>>@app.get("/all", apply=[jsoninator])
...def get_all_datasets() -> CupcakesResponse:
...    response.status_code = 200 # optional
...    return CupcakesResponse(12, "key_lime")


You can also specify the type of the request payload. If the request
Content-Type is application/json and it can be parsed into the shape requested,
your view will be called. Else, a 400 Bad request will be sent to the client.

Sample usage:
>>> @dataclass
... class CupcakesRequest(DictParseable):
...   @classmethod
...   def from_dict(cls, d: t.Dict) -> 'CupcakesRequest':
...     return CupcakesRequest(...)
...
>>> @app.post("/order-cupcakes/", apply=[jsoninator(CupcakesRequest)])
... def order_cupcakes(request:CupcakesRequest) -> CupcakesResponse:
...    <do stuff with request>

    Bottle plugin which allows you to create 'typed' views.

    Views are expected to return an object which has a to_json method. The
    content_type header will be automatically set, but if you need to set
    anything else, eg. status code or other headers, continue to use
    `bottle.response`.

    If request type provided like jsoninator(RequestType), will de-serialize
    request payload into the first argument to the view function.

    # I feel like I'm doing a lot of work to support a common API for typed
    # request payloads and untyped request payloads.  All this could be avoided
    # by having `jsoninator` and `jsoninator_typed_request(RequestType)`, but
    # meh! This looks shinier. All the complexity is hidden behind a single
    # method call.

    # Super verbose description of decorator BEGINS

    # A decorator is just a function that returns another function where the
    # returned function has some semantics. [Link to decorators
    # tutorial](https://realpython.com/primer-on-python-decorators/) If you are
    # familiar with decorators, continue reading this comment.

    # When you add jsoninator without arguments to bottle's apply=[..] list, it will
    # call jsoninator with the view function. As is typical with decorators.

    # When you add jsoninator with some arguments, python will first execute the
    # function, and then use the return value as a decorator.

    # Super verbose description of decorator ENDS

    # instead use the from_dict class method to determine if this is a decorator
