"""
Mappings from threatexchange types to hmalib types or vice-versa. Must only have
constants.

python-threatxchange defines types for content, signal and indexes. However,
hmalib sometimes extends these types. Eg. We extend Indexes to provide S3
storage. In those cases, the mapping in python-threatexchange is out-of-date and
we must provide a mapping in hmalib land.

If you find yourself needing a map between hmalib types or hmalib and
python-threatexchange types, they should go here.

If you find yourself needing a map between python-threatexchange types alone,
they should go into python-threatexchange. eg. threatexchange.content_type.meta.
