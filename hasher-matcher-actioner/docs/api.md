# API

While HMA provides a simple UI for debugging and development, scanning content at scale will require API integration. Additionally, if you wish to provide a UI with more capabilities like access control, you can use the API to build a more featureful version of the debugging UI.

Note that there are multiple ways to set up a production deployment with their own cost tradeoffs. See [architecture.md](./architecture.md) for more details, especially about which stage to do hashing.

## Accessing the API

Some endpoints may only be available to specific roles. All endpoints are based upon the HMA process's base URL.
In the monolithic docker compose setup from this repository, that will be `http://localhost:5100`.

**Note**: The API docs are a work in progress and may be missing some (useful) endpoints.

### Status/Information

When HMA has started up, it will respond 200 OK to `GET /status`.

The full list of paths available to the caller can be found at `GET /site-map`. The response will be a JSON array similar to the following:
```json
[
  "/",
  "/c/bank/<bank_name>",
  "/c/bank/<bank_name>/content",
  "/c/bank/<bank_name>/content/<content_id>",
  "/c/bank/<bank_name>/content/<int:content_id>",
  "/c/bank/<bank_name>/signal",
  "/c/banks",
  "/c/content_type",
  "/c/exchange/<string:exchange_name>",
  "/c/exchange/<string:exchange_name>/status",
  "/c/exchanges",
  "/c/exchanges/api/<string:api_name>",
  "/c/exchanges/apis",
  "/c/signal_type",
  "/c/signal_type/<signal_type_name>",
  "/c/signal_type/index",
  "/h/hash",
  "/m/compare",
  "/m/index/status",
  "/m/lookup",
  "/m/raw_lookup",
  "/site-map",
  "/status",
  "/ui/",
]
```

## Hashing

What ContentTypes and SignalTypes are supported are configured on deployment.

### Hashing content by URL

Endpoint: `GET /h/hash?url=<your_url>`
Sample JSON response (SignalType to value):
```json
{"pdq":"d811ac390bfa6005d08543fe27fd5a11f6b55bdd2603000dc26476fc79fc76b5"}
```

Example:
```bash
curl -s -X GET http://localhost:5100/h/hash?url=https://example.org/path/to/file.png
```

### Hashing content by bytes

This endpoint uses a `multipart/form-data` request body. The field name is the ContentType (typically `photo` or `video`) to hash with.

Endpoint: `POST /h/hash`
Sample JSON response (SignalType to value):
```json
{"pdq":"d811ac390bfa6005d08543fe27fd5a11f6b55bdd2603000dc26476fc79fc76b5"}
```

Example:
```bash
curl -s -X POST --form photo='@example.png' http://localhost:5100/h/hash
```

### Hashing and matching

**Warning**: This endpoint may be slow. Large timeout values or long-polling are recommended.

This endpoint will hash *and* match in the same operation. Some deployments may prefer to split these functions and use dedicated endpoints described throughout this document.

This endpoint uses a `multipart/form-data` request body. The field name is the ContentType (typically `photo` or `video`) to hash with.

Endpoint: `POST /m/lookup`
Sample JSON response (SignalType to Bank Name to content matches):
```json
{
  "pdq":{
    "TEST_BANK":[
      {"bank_content_id":1,"distance":"0"}
    ]
  }
}
```

**Note**: An internal coinflip will be performed and compared to the enabled ratio of each bank. Only banks which pass this coinflip (1.0 being always include, 0.0 being never include) will be checked. The coinflip can be bypassed with a `?bypass_coinflip=true` query string parameter to the endpoint. A consistent seed can be supplied to the coinflip via the `?seed=1234` query string parameter.

Example:
```bash
curl -s -X POST --form photo='@example.png' http://localhost:5100/m/lookup?bypass_coinflip=false
```

## Matching

What SignalTypes, and what similarity settings to use (e.g. PDQ distance) are configured on deployment.

Additional SignalTypes can be made available by setting the `SIGNAL_TYPES` variable in the config.
Here is an example with CLIP signal type, after installing it with `pip install tx-extension-clip`:

```
from threatexchange.signal_type.pdq.signal import PdqSignal
from threatexchange.signal_type.md5 import VideoMD5Signal
from tx_extension_clip.signal import CLIPSignal

SIGNAL_TYPES = [PdqSignal, VideoMD5Signal, CLIPSignal]
```

- Index Status
  - Input
    - SignalType (`string`)
  - Output
    - Time of last index build

### Looking up a hash

Content matches in banks can be looked up by SignalType and value.

Endpoint: `GET /m/lookup?signal_type=<type>&signal=<value>`
Sample JSON response (Bank Name to content matches):
```json
{
  "TEST_BANK":[
    {"bank_content_id":1,"distance":"0"}
  ]
}
```

**Note**: An internal coinflip will be performed and compared to the enabled ratio of each bank. Only banks which pass this coinflip (1.0 being always include, 0.0 being never include) will be checked. The coinflip can be bypassed with a `?bypass_coinflip=true` query string parameter to the endpoint. A consistent seed can be supplied to the coinflip via the `?seed=1234` query string parameter.

Example:
```bash
curl -s -X GET "http://localhost:5100/m/lookup?signal_type=pdq&signal=d811ac390bfa6005d08543fe27fd5a11f6b55bdd2603000dc26476fc79fc76b5"
```

## Recording Review Results

- Record review led to discovery of harm - will communicate with exchanges if the exchange is configured to do so
  - Input
    - `list<string>` of Bank Content IDs
    - Optional `list<string>` of labels - if the label doesn’t match a bank labels it will change or prevent which information is recorded back to the exchange
- Record review did not lead to the discovery of harm
  - Input
    - `list<string>` of Bank Content IDs
    - Optional `list<string>` of labels - if the label doesn’t match a bank labels it will change or prevent which information is recorded back to the exchange
