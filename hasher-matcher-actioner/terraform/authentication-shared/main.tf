# This terraform configuration script is used in isolation to configure
# a shared shared user pool to be used across a team of developers /
# engineers that are collaborating on HMA developemnt within a single
# AWS account.

# The three resource configurations below were directly copied from
# /authentication/main.tf and adjusted so that their names were
# unique (to keep terraform state from getting confused). Consider
# /authentication/main.tf when making changes here.
