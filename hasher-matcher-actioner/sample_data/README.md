This is sample data pulled from ThreatExchange that is in the public set, and doesn't contain anything malicious.

PDQ image data is derived from the copydays and holidays dataset:

Warning: The values of `holidays-jpg1-pdq-hashes.csv` and `holidays-jpg2-pdq-hashes.csv` (apart from the hashes themselves), should be viewed as completely random. The associated IDs may or may not exist (as something else) in the ThreatExchange Universe.
