"""
Abstraction around efficient scaled matching of SignalTypes

This usually involves build an efficient datastructure for lookups
(aka, an index).

At scale, the flow for matching looks something like:
1. Fetch information from API, store it locally
2. Process local copy of the information, separate it out by
   which system will consume it
3. Build indices for distribution (or deltas to those indices if
   you are really fancy)
4. In the service that does matching, swap out the index to the
   new one.
5. Hash content at upload sites, check against the service hosting
   the index.

    Abstraction for efficient scale matching on signals.

    SignalType forces you to implement the brute force approaches to
    make them easier to work with and conceptualize. However, if you
    are intending to match thousands of items a second at the scale of
    millions of signals, this class allows you to implement a more
    complex and efficient method.

    This class can be thought of as just a Dict[hash, List[T]] interface
    that can return the flattened result of multiple entries on a get().

    The T can be whatever metadata might be useful, although be warned
    that not all T may serialize correctly.

    # Handling Index Types that cannot be updated
    The default interface assumes that you can both create and update
    indices. It's possible that some storage types cannot support this.
    In that case build() and deserialize() are the only methods that
    should be used to create indices, and you can have add() methods
    throw NotImplementedError.

    # Handling Restricted Value Types
    In cases where your underlying index has limited type support for
    values (i.e. FAISS seems to only support ints), the easiest workaround
    is to just generate your own internal ids and maintain a separate map of
    the real results.
