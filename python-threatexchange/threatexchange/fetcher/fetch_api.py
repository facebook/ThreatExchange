    APIs to get and maybe put signals.

    updates.

    externally hosted servers, it might be useful to write adopters for
    certain formats of local files, which could be valuable for testing.

    which is unique to that API. Additionally, it a assumed that there
    might be multiple contributors (owners) to signals inside of an API.

    An instance of this class can retain state (caching connecting, etc)
    as needed.

    Methods with an implementation are optional, but may rely on

    Some APIs may not have any concept of owner ID (because the owner is the
    API itself). In that case, it's suggested to use 0 for all IDs. If the you
    own the API, it may also make sense to have 0 be the return of
    get_own_owner_id, which is used by matching to tell if a signal be
    considered "confirmed" or not. If your API does support the concept of
    owners, make sure to implement resolve_owner and get_own_owner_id
